# LGP-Sentence-Composition
A MediaPipe project that allows anyone to write a sentence using gestual language from the LGP (Linguagem Gestual Portuguesa) easily. Custom gestures can be made without knowledge of MediaPipe or Python, just by using a simple UI.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start
Run via local Python:
```bash
cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

Run via docker:
```bash
docker compose build
```

## ü§î Usage
Open the app.
```bash
python3 main.py
```

How to create a new gesture:
```bash
Inside the UI, press the "C" button to create a new gesture using our Gesture Creator UI.
```

If you want to create a new gesture using code, head to ``src/gestures/``, create a new gesture inside letters, numbers, saudations or verbs and add it to the dictionary on ``lgp_recognition.py``.

Run via docker:
```bash
docker compose build
```

## üìñ Additional information
This project was done in a university course, so it is not production ready. It is a proof of concept that MediaPipe can be used to create a gestual language detection and sentence building app. If you wish to research this matter, feel free to contact us to collaborate or ask any questions.

## üîÆ Future work
For future development, the group envisions using embeddings to enhance gesture recognition. Rather than relying on manually defined distances between finger landmarks, this approach would represent each gesture as a single vector automatically learned by a model.
To achieve this, 21 hand landmarks (each with x, y, z coordinates) would be extracted per frame, resulting in a 63-dimensional input vector. This data would be normalised (e.g. centred around the wrist and scaled), then passed into a model that transforms it into a compact embedding representing the overall gesture.
This method has the potential to make the system more scalable, adaptable, and robust to variations across different users and conditions.
